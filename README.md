# Poodle 😎
This is a Classroom Based Web App for connecting the students and teachers for the classes and assignments handling.

### 👩‍ 💻Technologies Used
* 🔥 **Django** : Python Based Full Stack Web Framework.
* 🔥 **Bootstrap** : To cut short the time for frontend and focusing more on the logics, using the power of Bootstrap.
* 🔥 **PostgreSQL** : Using SQLite in the local development and PostgreSQl in the production.
* 🔥 **Heroku** : Using the excellent platform of Heroku to host my project.

### 💡 Features
* ✔️ **Rich Admin Panel** : The best part of using Django is the excellent Admin Panel that it gives by default. All the superusers(having staff status) have the access to admin panel from where they can control the whole webapp, make any changes to the database or look into the whole data easily. Here's a glimpse of the admin panel.
